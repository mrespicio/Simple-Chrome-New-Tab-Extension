# Simple-Chrome-New-Tab-Extension
Date: February 2018 </br>
A personal project to familiarize myself with HTML/CSS/Javascript. Google Chrome extension that simply displays the current time and date whenever a new tab is open. Currently, there is no option to change the time/date format nor change the color of the background. Future options may be added. </br> </br>

<b>manifest.json:</b> Contains important information for the extension. </br>
<b>index.html:</b> HTML file that displays when a new tab is open. </br>
<b>displayDate.js:</b> Javascript file that contains the function that gives us the current date. </br>
<b>displayTime.js:</b> Javascript file that contains the function that gives us the current time. </br>
<b>style.css:</b> CSS file that formats the date/time and the page design. </br>
<b>icon.png:</b> Small icon displayed in Google Chrome.
<b>popup.html:</b> HTML file that displays when the icon is clicked on. </br>
