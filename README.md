# Simple-Chrome-New-Tab-Extension
Date: February 2018
A personal project to familiarize myself with HTML/CSS/Javascript. Google Chrome extension that simply displays the current time and date whenever a new tab is open. Currently, there is no option to change the time/date format nor change the color of the background. Future options may be added.
